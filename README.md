The project aims to provide researchers, in particular in the field of predictive modelling for health outcomes (e.g. predicting a disease incidence) with user-friendly functions to embed tree-based machine learning algorithms into the classical Cox proportionate hazards model. The algorithms can provide better predictive performance compared to a baseline Cox model and quantify and identify non-linear and interaction relationship between the predictors. Moreover, if Cox PH model have not been outperformed by the ensemble methods, it can be used as a reassurance that the data is unlikely to contain strong non-linearities, and classical Cox PH is as suited for the modelling its dependencies.
