### Ensemble methods for survival analysis
The project aims to provide researchers in the field of predictive modelling for health outcomes (e.g. predicting a disease incidence) with user-friendly functions to embed tree-based machine learning algorithms into the classical Cox proportionate hazards model (Cox PH). 

The algorithms can provide better predictive performance compared to the baseline CoxPH and quantify contribution of the non-linear relationships into the predictive preformance. The situation, when CoxPH have not been outperformed by the ensemble methods, can be used as a sign that strong non-linearities are unlikely to be present in the data, and classical CoxPH is as suited for analyzing such data.
